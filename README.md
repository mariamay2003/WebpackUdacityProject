# News Article Evaluation with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Project Description
This project uses the Udacity-hosted AWS NLP API to analyze news articles or blog posts by evaluating their sentiment. The goal is to practice working with Webpack, APIs, and service workers, while creating a page that can send and receive HTTP requests to an NLP API. The project helps in understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a subfield of AI concerned with the interaction between computers and human languages.

### Key Features:
- Sentiment analysis of articles.
- Integration with an external NLP API to analyze text.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- Service workers for offline functionality.
